1. Go to [](https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/) and navigate to the **Latest Release heading**.  You’ll see a column titled **Build Name**.  Click on the build number that corresponds to the version of Eclipse you downloaded for class.  It will likely be version 4.14 (or higher), but if you’re unsure, just open Eclipse and click on the “About Eclipse” tab in the top menu bar.
